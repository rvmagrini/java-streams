- [3.1] Using IntStream to print a Range of numbers (exclusive and inclusive), Iterate Lists and Create a specific Iteration

### 4: [MIN AND MAX]
- [4.1] Finding Min and Max number of a List

### 5: [REMOVING DUPLICATES]
- [5.1] Using distinct() to remove duplicates and Collectors.toSet() to create a Set

### 6: [FILTERING DATA]
- [6.1] Working with filter(), takeWhile() and dropWhile()
- [6.2] Working with findFirst() and findAny()
- [6.3] Working with allMatch() and anyMatch()

### 7: [TRANSFORMATIONS]

- [8.2] Working with average() and sum()
- [8.3] Working with summaryStatistics()
- [8.4] Working with Collectors.groupingBy to group and count data

### 9: [SORTING]
- [9.1] Working with map() and sorted() to sort Elements (natural order and reverse)
- [9.2] Working with sorted() to sort Objects (natural order and reverse) without mapping
- [9.3] Sort top ten most expensive blue cars of a List of Objects
